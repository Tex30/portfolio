                        <p>Salifort Motors was experiencing high turnover rates that were affecting their business in multiple ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High turnover costs (1.5-2x annual salary per employee lost)</li>
                            <li>Decreased team productivity during transition periods</li>
                            <li>Lost institutional knowledge and expertise</li>

                        <p>The XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting employee turnover:</p>

                            <li>Discovered department-specific turnover patterns requiring targeted interventions</li>
                            <li>Developed an early warning system capable of identifying 93% of employees at risk of leaving</li>
                            <li>Created data-driven recommendations that could potentially reduce turnover costs by $1.2M annually</li>

                        <p>The model identified the following as the top predictors of employee turnover:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Satisfaction level</strong> (29% importance) - Employees with satisfaction scores below 0.4 were 4.5x more likely to leave</li>
                            <li><strong>Weekly hours</strong> (18% importance) - Working over 50 hours/week increased turnover probability by 270%</li>
                            <li><strong>Number of projects</strong> (14% importance) - Both too few (1-2) and too many (6+) projects correlated with higher turnover</li>
                            <li><strong>Time since last promotion</strong> (12% importance) - Employees not promoted in 4+ years showed 3.2x higher turnover</li>
                            <li><strong>Salary level</strong> (11% importance) - Low-salary employees had 2.8x higher turnover than high-salary counterparts</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Identified Employee Segments</h3>
                        <p>Cluster analysis revealed four distinct employee segments at risk:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Overworked high-performers</strong> (25% of departures) - High project load, long hours, high evaluations</li>
                            <li><strong>Undervalued veterans</strong> (22% of departures) - Long tenure, few promotions, stagnant salary growth</li>
                            <li><strong>Disengaged newcomers</strong> (18% of departures) - Low satisfaction, less than 2 years at company</li>
                            <li><strong>Career-blocked specialists</strong> (16% of departures) - Medium tenure, high skill, limited advancement opportunities</li>

                                <p>Introduce flexible scheduling options across all departments and actively monitor overtime hours. Create a culture where taking personal time is encouraged, not penalized, with managers modeling appropriate boundaries.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
                        <p>To effectively implement these recommendations, I proposed the following action plan:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Deploy Early Warning System (1-2 months):</strong> Integrate the predictive model into HR systems to identify at-risk employees and enable proactive intervention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pilot Targeted Interventions (2-3 months):</strong> Select high-risk departments for initial implementation of retention strategies, focusing on quick wins and measurable outcomes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scale Successful Programs (3-6 months):</strong> Evaluate pilot results and expand successful initiatives company-wide, with customizations based on departmental needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhance Data Collection (Ongoing):</strong> Identify additional data points to improve model accuracy, including exit interview insights and employee engagement metrics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Measure Financial Impact (6-12 months):</strong> Calculate cost savings and ROI of retention initiatives, tracking key metrics including turnover rate, replacement costs, and productivity impacts.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Reflections & Lessons Learned</h3>
                        <p>This project reinforced the importance of careful data preparation and feature engineering in building effective predictive models. The most valuable insight was learning to balance technical sophistication with business interpretability - the most complex model isn't always the most useful if stakeholders can't understand how to act on its outputs.</p>
                        
                        <p>Key lessons learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Business context is critical:</strong> Understanding the true cost of turnover helped frame the problem and quantify the value of solutions</li>
                            <li><strong>Model explainability matters:</strong> Stakeholders needed to understand why employees were leaving, not just who might leave</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-functional collaboration:</strong> Working closely with HR experts improved feature selection and recommendation development</li>
                            <li><strong>Threshold optimization:</strong> Finding the right balance between precision and recall was essential for practical application</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Designing a feedback loop for model refinement as more data becomes available</li>
                        </ul>
